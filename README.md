# Week 3: Python Challenge 

This week we were challenged to use python to summarise csv files and output the results to a text files.  
This required two csv files provided by UWA with the following instructions. 

# Challenge 1 -PyBank Challenge
In this challenge we were tasked to create a Python script to analyse the financial records of a company.
A financial dataset called "budget_data.csv" was provided. The dataset composed of two columns: "Date and "Profit/Losses".

The challenge was to create a Python script that analysed the records to calculate the following values:
1. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
2. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
3. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
4. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## Challenge 2 PyBank Results: 
The analysis completed below was printed to the terminal and exported into a text file with the following results:

#Challenge 2: PyPoll Challenge 
In this Challenge, we were tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.
A set of poll dataset called "election_data.csv" was provided. The dataset composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

The task was to create a Python script that analysed the votes and calculated each of the following values:
1.The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

##Challenge 2 PyPoll Results: 
The analysis completed below was printed to the terminal and exported into a text file with the following results:
